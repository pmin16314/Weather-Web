# <b>Project Details</b>

<p>This is a simple single-page web application called The Weather Report. React Js was used to develop the website combined with the Tailwind CSS for styling. Current weather and the 7days forecast of any city in the world can be searched from this site. Two APIs were used to build this application. Geodb-Cities API was used to get the latitude and longitudinal coordinates by searching the city's name. Openweather API was used to get the current weather and the forecast respective to the searched coordinates. Asyncpagination was used to build the search bar. The live clock was built using the "Moment js".</p>

<p>Dark mode available. Not responsive for mobile devices yet.</p>
